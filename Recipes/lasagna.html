        <li>A pinch of nutmeg (approximately 4g.)</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper (according to the house)</li>
        <li>250 g. natural tomatoes (approximately 1 glass)</li>
        <li>250 ml of white wine (approximately 200 ml)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano leaves (or Provencal herbs)</li>
        <li>To make the b√©chamel: (for approximately one liter, enough for the lasagna): 125 g of all-purpose wheat flour</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps for lasagna meat</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Boil a large pot of water. Add 2 handfuls of salt.</li>
        <li>Insert the lasagna sheets one by one into the boiling water. Do not touch them so they don't stick.</li>
        <li>After about 10 minutes, remove the lasagna sheets from the water and spread them on blotting paper.</li>
        <li>Wash all the vegetables that you will use for the garnish. In the recipe, I recommend filling with the classic Bolognese sauce, carrots, garlic, bell peppers, and onions.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna by layering the lasagna sheets, sauce, ricotta cheese, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps for stuffed</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, about 10 minutes. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, oregano, salt, and pepper to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, then a layer of ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat layers until the dish is full, ending with a layer of sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
